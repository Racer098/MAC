                            <p class="mb-0"><br>If you obtain access to a network, such as a free cafe's WiFi, you will see the MAC addresses of every devices connected to the network. MAC addresses are attached to your hardware, which means that every time you connect to a network, it logs what device is accessing it, as well as the time and kind of bandwidth the device is using.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

                    <p>It identifies the same gadget if you go to the same coffee shop every week. They can also cross-reference surveillance video and MAC addresses to determine who is doing what on a network, and this becomes much more thorough with corporations like Starbucks, which saves this information across all of its locations.&nbsp;This is why you can go from Starbucks to Starbucks without having to re-login to the same device again.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Extra Information</h2>
                    <p>Because each MAC address is unique and associated with only your device, it becomes a tool that may be used to monitor you. When you walk about, your smartphone searches for neighbouring Wifi networks to connect to, broadcasting its MAC address in the process. Renew London utilised garbage bins in London to track people's travels throughout the city based on their MAC addresses, which may subsequently be linked to a person's identification.</p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/istockphoto-1249572084-170667a.jpg">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Tips and Tricks</h2>
                    <p>Open your device manager on Windows, right-click on the network interface, choose properties, advanced, network address, and enter a custom value. Keep in mind that your ethernet adapter will almost certainly use a different MAC address than your WiFi interface, so adjust both. SMAC is a Windows software that facilitates this. It is also possible to employ tools such as Technitium, however it is not entirely necessary. Try to do this as frequently as possible, or configure your system to use a different MAC address each time your computer wakes up.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Apple IOS&nbsp;</h2>
                    <p>iOS 14 introduces MAC address randomization, so just activate it per network! If you don't have iOS 14, you can tether internet traffic through your PC using a faked MAC address.</p><a href="#"></a>
